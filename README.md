# AC 2027 GA

This is a minimal React Progressive Web App scaffold created with create-react-app conventions.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm start
```

Build for production:

```powershell
npm run build
```

Notes:
- Routing is provided by `react-router-dom` (v6).
- Service worker registration is included in `src/serviceWorkerRegistration.js` to enable basic PWA features when built for production.
- Replace placeholder pages in `src/pages` with real content and assets.
